template.name: "1:Continuous Delivery Toolchain"
template.description: |
  2:This toolchain includes tools to develop and deploy your app. Depending on your
  app, when you create the toolchain, the Git repository will either be empty
  or will contain source code from your app.
  
  This toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If
  an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click
  **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information
  and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).

  To get started, click **Create**.
